      				While many users of Blur will find the search system sufficient for their
      				needs out of the box, the Blur platform exposes a simple set of lower-level 
      				primitives that allow the user to easily and quickly introduce new system behavior.
          </p>
          <!-- Disclaimer para for 0.2.4 -->
          <p class="lead">
          With this release, we expose the initial read-only constructs for the platform.  
          Future releases, will allow introduce more rich read-write constructs.
          </p>

          <strong>NOTE:</strong> In 0.2.4, the platform capability described here exists,
          but existing functionality of Blur has not yet been ported to use it.

							In modern open source search platforms, we find Lucene at the very core and 
							a monolithic application stack implemented on top of it handling the distributed 
							indexing, searching, failures, features, etc. Indeed, this was true of Blur
							as well.
						</p>	
						<p>We wanted more flexibility.  We wanted to rapidly be able to introduce brand new
							features into the system.  So, we supposed it would be helpful if an 
							intermediate abstraction could be introduced providing the primitives for a 
							distributed Lucene server on which specific search applications could be built. 
          	</p>
          	<p>Some specific goals we had in mind:</p>
          	<ul>
          	  <li>To allow for indexing/searching based on other/new data models (e.g. 
          	  		more than just the Row/Record constructs).</li>
							<li>Allow implementations to build whole new APIs given direct access to the Lucene primitives.</li>
							<li>Allow flexibility to build totally custom applications.</li>
							<li>Remove the complexities of threading, networking and concurrency from 
									new feature creation.</li>
