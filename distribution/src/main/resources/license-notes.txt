From the directory of the exploded binary package:

To see if there are files unaccounted for:

comm -3 <(cat ../../../LICENSE | grep ^./ | sort) <(find . -name *.jar | sort)

Some helpful commands:

Find any Apache Licensed jar file listed in our LICENSE that don't include a NOTICE file in the jar itself:
sort <(grep ALv2 LICENSE | awk '{print $1}') <(for f in `find . -name "*.jar"` ;do echo -n $f && printf ' NOTICE? %s\n' `jar -tf $f | grep NOTICE | wc -l` ;done | grep "NOTICE? 0" | awk '{print $1}') | uniq -d

Update the binary NOTICE file:
cd ./distribution/src/main/resources/notices
./generate-notice.sh > ../../../../../NOTICE
